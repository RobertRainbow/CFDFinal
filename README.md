I use 3 methods to get approximated solve and compare them with Riemann exact solve.
They are:
- TVD
- GVC+FVS+RK3
- WENO+FDS+RK3

I write report with Latex to explain my code.

- Request.pdf

This is requests from teacher for final homework.

- Report Folder
Report.pdf is my final report file.

Folder "fig" saves my figures to complie and run Report.tex.

- Cold Folder
Folder "Riemann" saves my code and mv for Riemann exact solution.

Folder "data" saves my code and data for analysising data from different solutions and how to compare them.

Folder "Approximated" saves my code and data for geting solutions using 3 methods and mvs to visualizing process of solutions.
